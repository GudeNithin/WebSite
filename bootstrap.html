      <h3>1.HOW TO LEARN FARMING?</h3>
      <center><img src="C:\Users\chand\Desktop\Html\t1.jpg" height="200px"></center>
      <p>Farming is a way of life, and also a business that gives you less of a financial "reward" for all the hard work you have to do throughout the year. But, the emotional and spiritual reward you get can be accounted for more than the paycheck you get at the end of the year.
      I appreciate your interest in taking up farming as your career after your middle age. Educated people like must enter into commercial agriculture. There is going to be an excellent future for high-tech precision agriculture in the next 10–20 years.

      Farming is a noble occupation in theory, but in practice the society doesn’t respects farmers. This is a fact that you must understand well before your enter into farming.
      Farming is a high-risk enterprise where many factors such as weather, market and price fluctuations, and destruction by wild animals adversely affect the farming. You must understand this reality in farming.
      If you are sincere and truthful in producing nutritious and pesticide-free produce for people to enjoy, you are serving the community in a positive way and you can also develop a special brand that can command higher value and price from markets, as you go along. This must be your primary motive in taking up farming.
      You can make money in farming, if you provide the specialty produce in off-seasons when other farmers cannot compete with you. For this, you have to have greenhouses and vertical farming including hydroponics or aquaponics.
      Integrated mixed farming of crops and animals (preferably goats and ducks) or crops-animals-trees (agroforestry systems), or crops-animals-fish farming. This is the best to minimize risks and maximize profits.
      How do you prepare yourself for your future farming career?

      <h3>2.WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS FACED?</h3>
      <center><img src="C:\Users\chand\Desktop\Html\t2.jpg" height="200px"></center>
      <p>Every day, the food we eat connects us to a vast global web of farmers, traders, food manufacturers, retailers and many other people involved in getting food from farm to fork. Most of us probably don’t pause to think about it while biting into a piece of fruit or a slice of bread, but this global food system is central to some of the biggest challenges facing humanity.
        <p>1. Small and fragmented land-holdings:
           The seemingly abundance of net sown area of 141.2 million hectares and total cropped area of 189.7 million hectares (1999-2000) pales into insignificance when we see that it is divided into economically unviable small and scattered holdings.
           The average size of holdings was 2.28 hectares in 1970-71 which was reduced to 1.82 hectares in 1980-81 and 1.50 hectares in 1995-96. The size of the holdings will further decrease with the infinite Sub-division of the land holdings.</p>

        <p>2. Seeds:
           Seed is a critical and basic input for attaining higher crop yields and sustained growth in agricultural production. Distribution of assured quality seed is as critical as the production of such seeds. Unfortunately, good quality seeds are out of reach of the majority of farmers, especially small and marginal farmers mainly because of exorbitant prices of better seeds.</p>

       <p> 3. Manures, Fertilizers and Biocides:
           Indian soils have been used for growing crops over thousands of years without caring much for replenishing. This has led to depletion and exhaustion of soils resulting in their low productivity. The average yields of almost all the crops are among t e lowest in the world. This is a serious problem which can be solved by using more manures and fertilizers.</p>

        <p>4. Irrigation:
           Although India is the second largest irrigated country of the world after China, only one-third of the cropped area is under irrigation. Irrigation is the most important agricultural input in a tropical monsoon country like India where rainfall is uncertain, unreliable and erratic India cannot achieve sustained progress in agriculture unless and until more than half of the cropped area is brought under assured irrigation.</p>

      <h3>3.HOW TO IMPROVE GROWTH?</h3>
      <center><img src="C:\Users\chand\Desktop\Html\t3.jpeg" height="200px"></center>
     <p>Access to clean, reliable energy enables farmers and agribusinesses to increase food production and engage in value-added processing. It also allows farmers living in off-grid areas to replace expensive diesel generators with new and cleaner technologies, such as solar food dryers and solar water irrigation.
     In the past several years, growers have tightly sealed their greenhouses to reduce heat losses and save on fuel costs, but the consequence can be slower plant growth. If crops develop roots slowly, if shoot growth is retarded, or if plants don't use much water, then these are signs that one or more ingredients of photosynthesis is in short supply. In that case, you would be wise to identify the limitation(s) and then take corrective action so that photosynthesis can proceed unimpeded.</p>
